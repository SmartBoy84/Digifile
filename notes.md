First trick was basically exploiting the fact that they forgot to actually disable downloading/printing.
Heck, they just had an element in plainsight that one could press and call it a day!

New method will be slightly more resistant to patching and be more versatile.
I have checked and it's possible to simply use Chromium API to take screenshots of the canvas elements.

Done! Scaler res is broken though - I have gotten custom zoom values to work before but it's patchy (for some reason)
